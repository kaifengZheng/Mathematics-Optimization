There are 4 scipts in this program.
     * functiontest           The main function to run the program It includes plots function here
     * autoDQ               The program can use to caculate Hessian, gradients and function value.
     * steepest              The steepest descent method with a backtracking approach writed here.
     * newton                Newton method with a backtracking approach writed here. 


EXEMPLE:
Please tell the program how many variables of this function: 2
Please input the function you want to optimize with variable x(1),x(2),....: 100*(x(2)-x(1)^2)^2+(1-x(1)^2)
Please put the point coordinate which you prefer to start: [2.4,4]
How large the stepsize you would like to use: 2
Please choose one method you want use 1 == Steepest Descent 2 == Newton Method: 1
